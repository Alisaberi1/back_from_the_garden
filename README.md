# back_from_the_garden
Rodzyanko Dobromil Vyacheslavovich, who is a lazy and greedy person, went to the park. The park is in the form of a Cartesian coordinate plane from above. Radzinka is sitting at a point in the park at xx and yy coordinates and is staring at the horizon (to the positive side of yy). Radzinka's friend, who is located at the coordinates x1x1 and y1y1, calls him. Radzin wants to turn his head, look at him and answer him. But due to laziness, he wants to turn his head in the direction that has the least amount of rotation. Help him choose the right direction.
# input

In the first line of the entry, xx and yy are shown, showing where Radzin is sitting. In the second line, there are two numbers x1x1​ and y1y1​, which indicate the place where Radzinka's friend is located. It is guaranteed that the rotation angle is different from left and right in the tests.

−1000≤x,y,x1,y1≤1000−1000≤x,y,x1​,y1​≤1000
# output

Print Right if he should turn his head to the right and Left if he should turn his head to the left.
